A basic recipe website 

	This project is about building a basic recipe website using HTML.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes

 By the end of this project i would have demonstrated my ability to;

    - Design a structure of an HTML page containing in it relative links redirecting to other webpages.
